Introduction
====================================================

Using the functions described above, we will explain actual cases of dry and wet disinfection.

Due to the regulation-free special zone demonstration project, it was demonstrated in the annex of Daegu City Hall.

It is divided into two types: dry disinfection in the corridor and wet disinfection in the conference room.

So, I will explain Run HDI, CRDI, and Schedule, which are functions that are in the gui but have not been explained.
